just some coding ideas

1. an **application** that lets watch youtube together
2. budgeting **(mobile) application** (apple apps are very costly)
    - minimal
    - expense includes categories, notes, attachments
    - budgeting includes segragation of income across attributes
    - some kind of goal setting and maybe rate an expense (rate an expensive, unsatisfying food order as "excessive")
4. grading **DASHBOARD**
    - data entry
    - csv upload
    - unlimited assignments and weightage options
    - extra- grading patterns
    - csv download
5. **automate instagram**, facebook, youtube upload. (consider using regex for dates and nomenclature)
6. minimal journaling app, one sentence/three words, one photo, 3 habits, 1 gratitude, 1 regret/change
7. script for translating youtube playlist to audiobook.
8. clock app
    - analog sounds
    - with customised intervals
    - (pro) custom sounds
    - meant for workouts, meditation, etc
    - comes from my understanding of stretching and not being able to keep track of time.
    - we count faster during harder exercises
9. calendar app
    - the year, the month and the day is a line
    - every task project has an end, a start and points where work was done.
10. audiobook player
    - add a random excerpt function that tries and find an excerpt to play.
    - probably find moments of silents between certain time frame possibilities.
11. midi bluetooth app
    - able to connect to system using bluetooth
    - sends MIDI msgs using Bluetooth (maybe intentionally exclude USB)
    - probably going to have latency issues (but ok for ambient/few notes stuff)
   
12. cpp exercise - build an app to compare casts across movies and series
    - minimal keyboard
12. vcv counter (hour glass)
    - every trigger adds to counter
    - can send out triggers or gates at specific counter levels
    - add probability
    - focus around filling up of the hour class - two event outs or one (give minimal possible options to do its job)
